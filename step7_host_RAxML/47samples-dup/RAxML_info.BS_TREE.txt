You are using a proportion of Invariable sites estimate, although I don't
like it. The likelihood epsilon "-f e" will be automatically lowered to 0.001
to avoid unfavorable effects caused by simultaneous optimization of alpha and P-Invar

RAxML Bipartition Computation: Drawing support values from trees in file RAxML_bootstrap.trex_rep onto tree in file RAxML_bestTree.trex


RAxML was called as follows:

./raxmlHPC -m GTRGAMMAI -f b -s inputRaxML.phy -n BS_TREE -t RAxML_bestTree.trex -z RAxML_bootstrap.trex_rep 




Found 1 trees in File RAxML_bestTree.trex



Found 100 trees in File RAxML_bootstrap.trex_rep



Found 1 trees in File RAxML_bestTree.trex

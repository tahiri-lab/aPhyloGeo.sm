You are using a proportion of Invariable sites estimate, although I don't
like it. The likelihood epsilon "-f e" will be automatically lowered to 0.001
to avoid unfavorable effects caused by simultaneous optimization of alpha and P-Invar


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences GU190215-MZ936290 and NC_014470-MZ936290 are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences DQ084200-HM134917 and DQ022305-HM134917 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 2 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file inputRaxML.phy.reduced
